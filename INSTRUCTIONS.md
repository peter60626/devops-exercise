# DevOps exercise instructions

This exercise is to meant to test your DevOps skill and problem-solving skills. It is meant to be a short (30-60 minute) assignment, so obviously this test cannot test all skills that are desired for the position.

## Basics

- Fork or clone this repository.
- Please make sure you are committing your work.
- Submit your work as an archive of the project directory including the Git information.
- If you cannot finish or do all the things you would like to do in the suggested time, please note things you would like to do in the `README.md` or `NOTES.md` file.
- There may be areas of the code that could be improved. You can choose to do more to demonstrate your talents, but please do not exceed the 60 minute time limit.

## Containerization

There is a Python application in this repo. See `README.md` for instructions on the Python application runs, and determine anything that is not documented.

Create a `Dockerfile` that will run the Python application in a container.

## Continuous integration

Create a continuous integration/depployment plan and configuration to run Python tests and test your containerization.

## Document

Make sure to document how the project works and how a colleague would get up to speed in the `README.md` and add relevant coments. Entries with "TODO" in them are encouraged to be updated. Feel free to alter the `README.md` in anyway you want.
